## 1. üì¶ Imports Overview

### Time Manipulation Libraries

* **Data.Time**
  Provides general types and operations for working with date and time (`UTCTime`, `NominalDiffTime`).

* **Data.Time.Clock**
  Functions for time arithmetic and obtaining the current system time.

* **Data.Time.Clock.POSIX**
  Conversion utilities between POSIX timestamps and `UTCTime`.

* **Data.Time.Format.ISO8601**
  Parsing and formatting utilities specifically for ISO-8601 formatted strings.

* **Data.Time.Format**
  General parsing and formatting utilities for custom date-time formats.

* **Data.Time.LocalTime**
  Functions to handle local time based on the system's timezone.

---

## 2. ‚öôÔ∏è Core Functions

### üîÅ Conversion Functions

* **`utcToPOSIX`**
  Converts a UTC timestamp to a POSIX timestamp.

* **`iso8601ToPOSIX`**
  Parses ISO-8601 formatted strings to POSIX timestamps.

* **`posixToUTC`**
  Converts a POSIX timestamp back to UTC format.

* **`posixToISO8601`**
  Formats POSIX timestamps as ISO-8601 strings.

---

### üïí Current Time Retrieval

* **`getUTCNow`**
  Retrieves the current time as `UTCTime`.

* **`getPOSIXNow`**
  Retrieves the current time as a POSIX timestamp.

* **`getISO8601Now`**
  Retrieves the current time formatted as an ISO-8601 string.

* **`getTimeTriple`**
  Provides current time as `UTCTime`, POSIX timestamp, and ISO-8601 string simultaneously.

---

### ‚ûï Time Arithmetic

* **`addSeconds`, `addSecondsPOSIX`**
  Adds a specified number of seconds to `UTCTime` or POSIX timestamps.

* **`addDaysUTC`, `addDaysPOSIX`**
  Adds days (converted to seconds) to `UTCTime` or POSIX timestamps.

* **`diffSeconds`, `diffSecondsPOSIX`**
  Computes the difference in seconds between two timestamps (`UTCTime` or POSIX).

---

### üßæ Formatting and Parsing

* **`formatUTC`**
  Formats `UTCTime` with a custom format string.

* **`parseUTC`**
  Parses a string into `UTCTime` using a custom format.

* **`getLocalISO8601`**
  Obtains the local time formatted as an ISO-8601 string based on the system's timezone.

---

## 3. üß™ Practical Usage Examples

```haskell
-- Convert current UTC to POSIX timestamp
currentPOSIX :: IO POSIXTime
currentPOSIX = utcToPOSIX <$> getUTCNow

-- Parse ISO-8601 string and convert to POSIX timestamp
parseISO :: Maybe POSIXTime
parseISO = iso8601ToPOSIX "2025-05-04T14:30:00Z"

-- Format current time as ISO-8601
currentISO :: IO String
currentISO = getISO8601Now
```

---

## 4. üß∑ Testing Strategy

* ‚úÖ Verify round-trip conversions (`UTC` ‚Üî `POSIX` ‚Üî `ISO8601`).
* ‚úÖ Validate arithmetic operations with various time intervals.
* ‚úÖ Test custom formatting and parsing with different time string representations.

---

## 5. ‚úÖ Best Practices

* Always handle possible parsing errors explicitly.
* Regularly validate conversions to ensure they maintain integrity across different system timezones and edge cases.
* Keep your testing thorough and update your tests when modifying related functions to catch regressions early.

---

## 6. üß≠ Summary

This utility module makes working with blockchain timestamps much easier in both on-chain and off-chain code. It wraps verbose `Data.Time` functions in reusable, Plutus-friendly helpers that are useful for:

* Encoding vesting schedules
* Generating transaction validity intervals
* Printing debug timestamps
* Building CLI tools and test scripts

## 7. üìò Glossary of Terms

| Term                              | Definition                                                                               |
| --------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **`UTCTime`**                     | Coordinated Universal Time. A standard format for representing absolute time.            |
| **`POSIXTime`**                   | Time represented as seconds since the Unix epoch (1970-01-01T00:00:00Z). Used in Plutus. |
| **`ISO-8601`**                    | A standardized string format for timestamps, e.g., `"2025-05-04T14:30:00Z"`.             |
| **`NominalDiffTime`**             | Represents the difference between two points in time (in seconds).                       |
| **`addSeconds` / `addDaysPOSIX`** | Functions to add time to a timestamp.                                                    |
| **`diffSeconds`**                 | Computes duration between two timestamps.                                                |
| **`getTimeTriple`**               | Returns current time in all three formats (UTC, POSIX, ISO8601).                         |
| **`formatUTC`**                   | Converts a `UTCTime` to a custom-formatted string.                                       |
| **`parseUTC`**                    | Converts a string back into a `UTCTime`.                                                 |
| **`getLocalISO8601`**             | Returns current local time as ISO-8601 string.                                           |
